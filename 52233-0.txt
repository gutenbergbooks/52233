For forty-six miles THE SAN FRANCISCO AND NORTH PACIFIC RAILWAY, the
Picturesque Route of California, skirts the Russian River. A few of the
many lovely views en-route are shown in this little _brochure_.

This beautiful country was once occupied by the Pomo Indians, a brave
and flourishing tribe, of whom but very few families remain. Many of
the local features are hallowed by the Indian folk-lore. The legend of
Dah-nol-yo--Squaw Rock, so charmingly written by Mrs. H. M. Carpenter,
of Ukiah, is presented to the reader.

THE LEGEND OF DAH-NOL-YO--SQUAW ROCK.


Among the many extant Indian Legends of Squaw Rock, none has
appeared which relates to the face of stone, on the summit of this
noted mountain. The following is substantially as given by a direct
descendant of Con-che Tadi, a Pomo Chief, who lived in the shadow of
Dah-nol-yo, when time was young.

This Chief was particularly noted for preserving the peace and harmony
of his own tribe and others with which he came in contact. His faithful
squaw Ma-cha-ta (Kingfisher) devoted her time to her two sons, Ca-ba-ba
(Brave one) and Bu-tah-so (Little Bear); and as is the custom at the
present day, gathered the buckeye and acorn, as a means of subsistence,
while her lord smoked his pipe or enjoyed a nap in the sunshine. As the
sons approached manhood they were inseparable companions and partook of
the peaceful disposition of their illustrious father.

[Illustration: TWIN ROCKS, ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER--NEAR DAH-NOL-YO.]

One day, after vainly endeavoring to catch enough fish for dinner,
a very beautiful Indian woman suddenly appeared before them. When
she merely looked into the water, fish and turtles came out upon the
sand and lay at her feet. She pointed to the east and west, and all
kinds of birds and beasts were at once before her. Ca-ba-ba, the
elder son, who was to be Chief of the tribe when the Tadi went to
the “Happy Hunting Ground,” conceived the idea of making this young
woman his wife, feeling assured that at least a good living was in
store for him through this arrangement. Divining his thoughts (which
did not meet with her approval, as it is supposed she was already
enamored of Bu-tah-so,) she declared, in consequence of his selfish
motives, he should never be the Chief of his tribe, which so enraged
Ca-ba-ba that he threw a fishing spear at her. This missed its fair
mark and was buried in the bosom of Bu-tah-so. All was immediately in
darkness--thunder rolled, lightning flashed and the whole earth was
convulsed. From out the storm the woman’s voice was heard pronouncing
maledictions on the head of Ca-ba-ba and commanding him to hide
himself in Dah-nol-yo, and do penance for all time. While he suffered
in darkness, she said the face of Bu-tah-so should stand upon his
sepulchre as a warning to all evil doers. The disappearance of the
Chief’s sons and the face of one of them, engraved in stone, upon the
mountain overlooking their home, so frightened the tribe that they fled
to the north, and no tribe has since had the temerity to live in sight
of the face on Dah-nol-yo.

[Illustration: CAMP SCENE ON RUSSIAN RIVER ON LINE SAN FRANCISCO AND
NORTH PACIFIC RY.]

Here the legend ends, and we take up the threads and weave a little net
of well authenticated facts. When the San Francisco and North Pacific
Railway wound through the picturesque canyon of Che-hool-be-da-dah
(Russian River) a tunnel pierced the base of Dah-nol-yo, thus opening
the door of Ca-ba-ba’s prison and liberating him. In fear of detection,
and a return to his solitary quarters, he cautiously crept to his
childhood’s home only to find desolation. Turning his eyes to the
summit of Dah-nol-yo he was transfixed with terror at beholding the
face of Bu-tah-so looking grimly down upon him. Held by an invisible
power he gazes on, unable to turn his eyes even to the bear, deer,
quail and squirrel, that venture so near, peering in wonder at the lone
man who is to suffer on through all eternity as he keeps his silent
vigil of Dah-nol-yo.

The way to reach the Russian River and its scenic surroundings is by
the SAN FRANCISCO AND NORTH PACIFIC RAILWAY, the Picturesque Route of
California.

Continuous riding over this road does not become monotonous, owing to
the variety and constant change of scenery, traversing, as it does,
Marin, Sonoma, Russian River, Sanel and Ukiah Valleys.

The hand of man, in dotting the country with orchards, vineyards, grain
fields, homes, towns and villages, has most beautifully blended the
domestic with nature’s wildness.

From San Francisco to Ukiah, the terminus of the road, is only 113
miles.

The Counties tributary, Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake, are known
as the most fertile on the Pacific Coast. The winds from the Pacific
Ocean, tempered by the bordering coast range and redwood forests,
produce a mild and salubrious climate so enjoyable to the healthy and
refreshing to the weak.

The Hotels and Resorts, and the numerous and various mineral springs,
afford every opportunity for health and recreation.

This section is specially desirable to the home-seeker, owing to the
variety and profusion of products which can be raised, and without
irrigation; for in this section, renowned for its richness and
fertility and wonderful soil products, =there is not one acre under
irrigation=.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
