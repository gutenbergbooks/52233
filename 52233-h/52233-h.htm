<h2>THE LEGEND OF DAH-NOL-YO&mdash;SQUAW ROCK.</h2>


<p>Among the many extant Indian Legends of Squaw Rock, none has appeared which relates
to the face of stone, on the summit of this noted mountain. The following is substantially as given
by a direct descendant of Con-che Tadi, a Pomo Chief, who lived in the shadow of Dah-nol-yo,
when time was young.</p>

<p>This Chief was particularly noted for preserving the peace and harmony of his own tribe
and others with which he came in contact. His faithful squaw Ma-cha-ta (Kingfisher) devoted her
time to her two sons, Ca-ba-ba (Brave one) and Bu-tah-so (Little Bear); and as is the custom at
the present day, gathered the buckeye and acorn, as a means of subsistence, while her lord
smoked his pipe or enjoyed a nap in the sunshine. As the sons approached manhood they were
inseparable companions and partook of the peaceful disposition of their illustrious father.</p>

<p><a id="para1"></a>One day, after vainly endeavoring to catch enough fish for dinner, a very beautiful Indian
woman suddenly appeared before them. When she merely looked into the water, fish and turtles
came out upon the sand and lay at her feet. She pointed to the east and west, and all kinds of
birds and beasts were at once before her. Ca-ba-ba, the elder son, who was to be Chief of the
tribe when the Tadi went to the “Happy Hunting Ground,” conceived the idea of making this
young woman his wife, feeling assured that at least a good living was in store for him through
this arrangement. Divining his thoughts (which did not meet with her approval, as it is supposed
she was already enamored of Bu-tah-so,) she declared, in consequence of his selfish motives, he
should never be the Chief of his tribe, which so enraged Ca-ba-ba that he threw a fishing spear
at her. This missed its fair mark and was buried in the bosom of Bu-tah-so. All was immediately
in darkness&mdash;thunder rolled, lightning flashed and the whole earth was convulsed. From out the
storm the woman’s voice was heard pronouncing maledictions on the head of Ca-ba-ba and
commanding him to hide himself in Dah-nol-yo, and do penance for all time. While he suffered
in darkness, she said the face of Bu-tah-so should stand upon his sepulchre as a warning to all
evil doers. The disappearance of the Chief’s sons and the face of one of them, engraved in
stone, upon the mountain overlooking their home, so frightened the tribe that they fled to the
north, and no tribe has since had the temerity to live in sight of the face on Dah-nol-yo.</p>

<p><a id="para2"></a>Here the legend ends, and we take up the threads and weave a little net of well authenticated
facts. When the San Francisco and North Pacific Railway wound through the picturesque canyon
of Che-hool-be-da-dah (Russian River) a tunnel pierced the base of Dah-nol-yo, thus opening the
door of Ca-ba-ba’s prison and liberating him. In fear of detection, and a return to his solitary
quarters, he cautiously crept to his childhood’s home only to find desolation. Turning his eyes
to the summit of Dah-nol-yo he was transfixed with terror at beholding the face of Bu-tah-so
looking grimly down upon him. Held by an invisible power he gazes on, unable to turn his eyes
even to the bear, deer, quail and squirrel, that venture so near, peering in wonder at the lone
man who is to suffer on through all eternity as he keeps his silent vigil of Dah-nol-yo.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The way to reach the Russian River and its scenic surroundings is by the <span class="smcap">San Francisco
and North Pacific Railway</span>, the Picturesque Route of California.</p>

<p>Continuous riding over this road does not become monotonous, owing to the variety and constant
change of scenery, traversing, as it does, Marin, Sonoma, Russian River, Sanel and Ukiah Valleys.</p>

<p>The hand of man, in dotting the country with orchards, vineyards, grain fields, homes, towns
and villages, has most beautifully blended the domestic with nature’s wildness.</p>

<p>From San Francisco to Ukiah, the terminus of the road, is only 113 miles.</p>

<p>The Counties tributary, Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake, are known as the most fertile
on the Pacific Coast. The winds from the Pacific Ocean, tempered by the bordering coast range
and redwood forests, produce a mild and salubrious climate so enjoyable to the healthy and
refreshing to the weak.</p>

<p>The Hotels and Resorts, and the numerous and various mineral springs, afford every
opportunity for health and recreation.</p>

<p>This section is specially desirable to the home-seeker, owing to the variety and profusion
of products which can be raised, and without irrigation; for in this section, renowned for its richness
and fertility and wonderful soil products, <b>there is not one acre under irrigation</b>.</p>
